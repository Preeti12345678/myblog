        <p>Jasmine is a fourteen year old girl and when she was younger she was a wild girl growing up in the Forests of Silence, and because of this she is capable of understanding and speaking to animals and trees. Her closest friends are the raven Kree and a Siskis named Filli. Jasmine is the daughter of Jarred and Anna.Lief and Barda met Jasmine in the beginning of their quest to restore the seven gems to the Belt of Deltora and joined them. They both helped her stay strong and she is a example of ups and downs but to stay strong no matter what. I really enjoyed reading her character!The third and last series once again follows the story of the three companions, but this time they must rid Deltora of the Sisters of the South. The Sisters are four creatures made from the hatred and sorcery of the Shadow lord. The Sisters sing a song so poisonous, that all the crops and food in Deltora is slowly dying, which would leave the land’s inhabitants to starve. To rid the land of these creatures, the three companions would need the help of Deltora’s most ancient creatures; the dragons.I really enjoyed the Deltora series as it is a series filled with adventure and a well-thought-out plotline. I also enjoyed Deltora because of the wonderful character development. Such as Lief starting out as a rash, immature, risk-taker, and slowly becoming more cautious and mature as the story gets deeper. I also loved the small riddles that can be found throughout the book that test your thinking in a variety of ways. However, my favorite aspect of the series are the plot twists and surprises. The books always seem to catch you off guard in some sort of way.In Conclusion, the Deltora Series is a book filled with magic, mystery, adventure, surprises, and in general is a very good time. The book earned a 5 out of 5 from me. I would highly recommend this series to everyone and it is worth picking up.</p>
